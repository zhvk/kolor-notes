    <string name="batman_ipsum">Batman Ipsum</string>
    <string name="batman_ipsum_1">Bats frighten me. It\'s time my enemies shared my dread. Swear to me!</string>
    <string name="batman_ipsum_2">Someone like you. Someone who\'ll rattle the cages. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.</string>
    <string name="batman_ipsum_3">The first time I stole so that I wouldn\'t starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.</string>
    <string name="batman_ipsum_4">I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. I can\'t do that as Bruce Wayne… as a man. I\'m flesh and blood. I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting.</string>
    <string name="batman_ipsum_5">My anger outweighs my guilt. Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire. I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men like this but I will not become an executioner. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.</string>
    <string name="batman_ipsum_6">I\'ll be standing where l belong. Between you and the people of Gotham. Someone like you. Someone who\'ll rattle the cages. It\'s ends here. The first time I stole so that I wouldn\'t starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.</string>
